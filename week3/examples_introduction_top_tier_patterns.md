#### **단계 1: Established Knowledge (확립된 지식)**

> From refusing to get vaccinated against COVID-19 (1) to ignoring worsening climate change (2), rejection of scientific information is costing lives now and will continue to do so in the future. One need only look at recent polling data to find concerning cases of public rejection of scientific evidence or denial of solutions with high levels of consensus among scientists. For example, a September 2021 poll found that only 61% of Americans saw COVID-19 as a major public health threat (3). Another recent poll found that 40% of Americans do not think climate change is a major threat (4). Additional examples abound around the world (5).

> Dismissal of scientific evidence is not a new phenomenon, however. When germ theory was proposed in the 19th century, an anticontagionist movement rejected the notion that disease could be spread through miniscule germs. Earlier scientific discoveries, such as the heliocentric nature of the solar system, were met with heavy opposition. But why? From early to contemporary examples, what are the psychological principles that account for people's antiscience views? That is, when different individuals are provided with the same piece of scientific evidence, why do some go on to accept and integrate it as a fact, whereas others dismiss it as invalid or irrelevant?

> Numerous scholars have pondered the antecedents of antiscience views. Existing models have identified factors that predict wariness of specific scientific innovations or theories (6, 7) or antiscience attitudes overall [e.g., the attitude roots and jiu jitsu models (8)]. These and other models noted throughout our article offer important insights.

#### **단계 2: Emerging Challenges (새로운 도전) - Conceptual Gap**

> But one theoretical paradigm that has been largely ignored in the antiscience literature, despite its substantive relevance, is the classic perspective on attitudes and persuasion (9). This is surprising, because antiscience views represent a crisis of attitudes due to both effective persuasion by antiscience sources and ineffective persuasion by scientific or "proscience" sources. This is also a missed opportunity, because classic work on persuasion has highlighted a number of explanatory processes and remediative strategies, many of which are highly applicable to the problem of antiscience attitudes.

#### **단계 3: Critical Gap (핵심 공백)**

> The goal of our article is to make these connections explicit and constructive. We do so by connecting contemporary findings and models in the antiscience literature to key principles from decades of research on attitudes, persuasion, social influence, social identity, and acceptance versus rejection of information writ large. Drawing these connections confers the dual scientific benefits of organizing our understanding of antiscience phenomena and delineating how classic components of persuasive processes formulated in the 20th century are impacted by new forms of social dynamics in the 21st century (e.g., vast and fast social network effects in the spreading of misinformation on social media).

#### **단계 4: Research Opportunity (연구 기회)**

> To organize these processes, we offer an inclusive framework that specifies four core bases of antiscience attitudes (Table 1, first column). In essence, people are prone to rejecting scientific messages when it comes from a source they do not find credible (basis 1), when they, as the recipient of the scientific message, identify with social groups that hold antiscience attitudes (basis 2), when the scientific message itself contradicts their related beliefs or attitudes (basis 3), or when it is delivered in ways that mismatch their motivational and cognitive approaches to information processing (basis 4). Each of these bases involves specific antecedents or predictors and elicits different nuances of psychological reaction (Table 1, second column); they also point to different counteractive strategies (Table 1, third column). Despite their differences in focus, the four bases are unified in revealing ways in which scientific information conflicts with people's existing content or style of thought.

### 예제 1.2: 인지심리학 - 작업기억과 주의의 관계 (가상 예제)

**저널**: Nature Human Behaviour
**주제**: Working Memory Capacity and Attentional Control

---

#### **단계 1: Established Knowledge (확립된 지식)**

> Working memory capacity (WMC) has long been established as a fundamental cognitive resource that predicts individual differences in complex reasoning, academic achievement, and fluid intelligence (1-3). Extensive research over the past three decades has demonstrated that individuals with higher WMC show superior performance across diverse cognitive tasks, from reading comprehension to mathematical problem-solving (4, 5). Neuroimaging studies have consistently linked WMC to prefrontal cortex (PFC) activation, particularly in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), suggesting a neural substrate for this capacity-limited system (6, 7). The prevailing theoretical framework posits that WMC reflects the ability to maintain goal-relevant information in an active state while simultaneously processing incoming information—a dual-process mechanism that enables cognitive control (8, 9).

**분석**:

---

#### **단계 2: Emerging Challenges (새로운 도전)**

> However, recent findings challenge this established framework. Studies examining the relationship between WMC and attentional control have revealed a puzzling dissociation: individuals with high WMC show superior performance in tasks requiring sustained attention (10, 11), yet paradoxically demonstrate *reduced* ability to filter irrelevant distractors in selective attention paradigms (12, 13). This counterintuitive pattern—where greater capacity appears to correlate with *worse* filtering—cannot be explained by existing dual-process models, which predict a monotonic relationship between capacity and control (14). Moreover, neuroimaging evidence suggests that high-WMC individuals show *increased* activation in both task-relevant and task-irrelevant brain regions during attention tasks, contradicting the assumption that capacity enables selective suppression (15, 16).

**분석**:

- ✅ **Paradox 제시**: "puzzling dissociation", "paradoxically", "counterintuitive"

- ✅ **이론적 도전**: "cannot be explained by existing models"
- ✅ **신경과학 증거**: 기존 이론과 반대되는 뇌 영상 결과

---

#### **단계 3: Critical Gap (핵심 공백)**

> This dissociation raises a fundamental question: **What mechanism explains why high working memory capacity, which facilitates goal maintenance, simultaneously impairs distractor suppression?** Current theoretical frameworks assume that capacity and control are positively correlated—an assumption that these empirical contradictions directly challenge. The field lacks a unified framework that can account for both the facilitative effects of WMC on sustained attention and its paradoxical costs for selective filtering. Specifically, we do not understand: (1) whether this dissociation reflects a trade-off between maintenance and suppression mechanisms, (2) whether individual differences in neural architecture (e.g., PFC connectivity patterns) predict this pattern, or (3) whether contextual factors (e.g., task demands, distractor salience) modulate the relationship between WMC and filtering ability.

---

#### **단계 4: Research Opportunity (연구 기회)**

> Here, we propose a **"capacity-control trade-off" framework** that reconciles these contradictions by positing that working memory capacity and attentional control engage partially competing neural resources. Using a combination of high-resolution fMRI, computational modeling, and behavioral experiments with large-scale individual differences (N=200), we test the hypothesis that high-WMC individuals allocate neural resources preferentially to maintenance processes, leaving fewer resources available for distractor suppression—a trade-off that manifests as superior sustained attention but impaired filtering. This framework predicts that contextual factors (distractor salience, task-switching demands) should modulate the WMC-control relationship in predictable ways. By identifying the neural and computational mechanisms underlying this trade-off, our findings will inform both theoretical models of cognitive control and practical interventions for attention disorders, where understanding individual differences in capacity-control dynamics is critical for personalized treatment.

### 예제 1.2: 사회심리학 - 도덕적 판단의 이중성

**저널**: Science
**주제**: Moral Judgment and Emotional vs. Rational Processing

---

#### **단계 1: Established Knowledge**

> Moral psychology has converged on a dual-process model of moral judgment: emotional, intuitive responses (System 1) versus deliberative, rational reasoning (System 2) (17, 18). Neuroimaging studies have consistently identified distinct neural networks—the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) for emotional processing and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) for controlled reasoning—supporting this dual-system architecture (19, 20). Behavioral evidence shows that moral dilemmas involving personal harm (e.g., pushing someone off a bridge to save five others) elicit strong emotional responses that often override utilitarian calculations, whereas impersonal dilemmas engage more deliberative processing (21, 22). This framework has been widely applied to explain moral intuitions, political attitudes, and intergroup conflict (23, 24).

---

#### **단계 2: Emerging Challenges**

> However, recent cross-cultural and developmental research has revealed systematic exceptions to this dual-process account. Studies across 60+ cultures show that moral judgments about harm, fairness, and authority vary dramatically across societies, with some cultures showing *reversed* patterns—where emotional responses favor utilitarian outcomes and reasoning favors deontological principles (25, 26). Developmental studies find that children as young as 3 years old make sophisticated moral distinctions that require complex reasoning, challenging the assumption that moral intuitions are primarily emotional and automatic (27, 28). Moreover, neuroimaging studies in non-Western populations show different neural activation patterns for identical moral dilemmas, suggesting that the "universal" dual-process architecture may be culturally constructed (29, 30).

---

#### **단계 3: Critical Gap**

> These findings raise a critical question: **If moral judgment is not universally organized around an emotion-reason dichotomy, what alternative framework can account for both the cross-cultural diversity and the within-culture consistency of moral reasoning?** The field lacks a theoretical model that can reconcile: (1) why some moral judgments appear universal (e.g., harm aversion) while others are culturally variable (e.g., authority respect), (2) how developmental trajectories shape moral reasoning differently across cultures, and (3) whether the neural architecture of moral judgment is itself culturally malleable or whether different cultures recruit the same neural systems differently.

---

#### **단계 4: Research Opportunity**

> We propose a **"cultural-developmental interaction" framework** that posits moral judgment emerges from the interaction between universal cognitive capacities (e.g., harm detection, fairness sensitivity) and culturally-specific learning environments that shape how these capacities are expressed. Using a multi-method approach combining fMRI in Western and East Asian participants (N=120), longitudinal developmental studies (ages 3-18, N=300), and computational modeling of moral learning, we test whether cultural differences in moral judgment reflect: (a) differential recruitment of shared neural systems, (b) culturally-specific neural specialization, or (c) both. This framework will advance our understanding of moral psychology beyond Western-centric models and inform interventions for moral education and conflict resolution across diverse cultural contexts.

#### **단계 1: Established Knowledge (확립된 지식)**

> Major depressive disorder affects approximately 7% of people in the US each year and represents one of the world's highest causes of disability. However, characterizing and treating this condition faces significant obstacles due to substantial symptom heterogeneity.

> Recent scientific approaches suggest that moving beyond diagnostic categories to examine how depression's core impairments—anhedonia and negative affect—relate to the neurocomputational foundations of reinforcement learning may enable more precise identification of disrupted processes and novel intervention targets.

> According to computational frameworks of reinforcement learning, outcome expectations are updated based on prediction errors. This approach separates learning into computationally distinct components linked to behaviorally and neurobiologically distinguishable processes, such as outcome valuation versus expectation updating. Computational model-based analyses can differentiate and quantify these learning mechanisms as parameters that may then be associated with individual-level symptoms. For depression, this methodology could identify sources of disrupted responsivity to rewards and losses, including altered value updating following feedback, relative valuation of positive or negative feedback, and changes in overall valuation of outcomes.

#### **단계 2: Emerging Challenges (새로운 도전) - Mechanism Unknown**

> Learning processes may be affected by both stimulus valence (reward versus loss learning) and depression symptoms. Regarding core depressive symptoms, anhedonia (reduced pleasure experience) may affect reward learning more substantially than depression broadly, while negative affect—characterized by subjective distress and negative cognitions—may be associated with altered loss and error processing. This symptom-specific approach aligns with research demonstrating symptom rather than diagnosis effects.

> **Demonstrating sensitivity to symptom change remains critical for establishing the translational relevance of biobehavioral psychiatric markers. Some evidence suggests successful depression treatment may normalize reward responses, yet how these changes relate to baseline impairments and whether they map onto mechanistic learning processes remain unclear.**

### 예제 2.2: 행동경제학 - 손실회피의 신경기전 (가상 예제)

**저널**: Nature Human Behaviour
**주제**: Loss Aversion - Neural Mechanisms of Asymmetric Valuation

---

#### **단계 1: Established Knowledge**

> Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most extensively studied and empirically supported psychological treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD), with meta-analyses demonstrating medium-to-large effect sizes (d=0.65-0.85) that are comparable to antidepressant medications (31, 32). Over 500 randomized controlled trials have established CBT's efficacy across diverse populations, age groups, and cultural contexts (33, 34). The core therapeutic mechanism is hypothesized to involve restructuring maladaptive cognitive patterns—specifically, challenging negative automatic thoughts and modifying dysfunctional beliefs—which leads to improved mood and functioning (35, 36). Behavioral outcomes are well-documented: CBT reduces depressive symptoms, improves quality of life, and prevents relapse with effects that persist for 12+ months post-treatment (37, 38).

---

#### **단계 2: Emerging Challenges**

> Despite this robust evidence for CBT's effectiveness, the **neural mechanisms** through which CBT produces therapeutic change remain largely unknown. Neuroimaging studies have shown that CBT is associated with changes in brain activity—including increased activation in prefrontal regions and decreased activation in limbic areas—but these findings are inconsistent across studies and do not reveal *how* CBT alters neural function to produce symptom improvement (39, 40). Some studies report CBT-induced changes in the same brain regions targeted by antidepressants (e.g., anterior cingulate cortex), suggesting shared mechanisms, while others find CBT-specific changes (e.g., increased connectivity in cognitive control networks), suggesting unique pathways (41, 42). This inconsistency raises questions about whether CBT works through: (a) normalization of dysfunctional neural circuits, (b) engagement of compensatory neural systems, or (c) both, and whether these mechanisms differ from those of pharmacotherapy.

---

#### **단계 3: Critical Gap**

> The critical gap is our lack of understanding of **the causal neural pathway through which CBT's cognitive restructuring produces therapeutic effects**. Specifically, we do not know: (1) whether CBT-induced changes in prefrontal-limbic connectivity *mediate* symptom improvement (causal pathway) or merely *correlate* with it (epiphenomenon), (2) whether these neural changes precede, accompany, or follow behavioral improvement, and (3) whether individual differences in baseline neural architecture predict who will benefit most from CBT. Without understanding these mechanisms, we cannot optimize CBT protocols, predict treatment response, or develop mechanism-based interventions that target the same neural pathways more efficiently.

---

#### **단계 4: Research Opportunity**

> Here, we use a randomized controlled trial design (N=80 MDD patients, CBT vs. waitlist control) combined with high-resolution fMRI at baseline, mid-treatment (4 weeks), and post-treatment (16 weeks) to test whether **changes in prefrontal-amygdala functional connectivity mediate CBT's therapeutic effects**. We hypothesize that CBT works by strengthening top-down cognitive control (dlPFC) over bottom-up emotional reactivity (amygdala), and that this connectivity change will: (a) precede symptom improvement (establishing temporal precedence), (b) statistically mediate the relationship between CBT and symptom reduction (establishing mediation), and (c) predict long-term treatment response. By identifying the causal neural mechanism, our findings will inform: (1) personalized treatment selection (who should receive CBT vs. medication), (2) mechanism-based CBT optimization (targeting specific neural pathways), and (3) development of neural biomarkers for treatment monitoring.

### 예제 2.2: 행동경제학 - 손실회피의 신경기전

**저널**: Nature Human Behaviour
**주제**: Loss Aversion - Neural Mechanisms of Asymmetric Valuation

---

#### **단계 1: Established Knowledge**

> Loss aversion—the tendency to weight losses more heavily than equivalent gains—is one of the most robust and well-replicated findings in behavioral economics, with a meta-analytic loss-to-gain ratio of approximately 2:1 across hundreds of studies (43, 44). This phenomenon has been documented across diverse decision contexts, from financial investments to health choices, and across cultures, though with some variation (45, 46). Neuroeconomic studies have consistently linked loss aversion to increased activation in the amygdala and anterior insula—brain regions associated with negative emotion and pain processing—when individuals face potential losses compared to gains (47, 48). The prevailing explanation is that losses are more emotionally salient than gains, leading to asymmetric neural and behavioral responses (49, 50).

---

#### **단계 2: Emerging Challenges**

> However, recent findings challenge this emotional salience account. Studies using computational modeling of choice behavior reveal that loss aversion persists even when emotional responses are controlled for, suggesting that the phenomenon may reflect a fundamental asymmetry in *valuation processes* rather than simply emotional reactivity (51, 52). Neuroimaging studies show that loss aversion correlates with activity in valuation regions (ventromedial prefrontal cortex, striatum) more strongly than with emotional regions (amygdala), raising questions about whether emotion is the cause or consequence of loss aversion (53, 54). Moreover, lesion studies in patients with amygdala damage show preserved loss aversion, contradicting the assumption that amygdala-mediated emotion drives the effect (55, 56). These findings suggest that loss aversion may emerge from asymmetric *encoding* of value in reward-processing circuits, not from emotional amplification of losses.

---

#### **단계 3: Critical Gap**

> The critical question is: **What is the neural mechanism that produces asymmetric valuation of losses versus gains?** We do not understand whether loss aversion reflects: (1) asymmetric encoding of value in shared reward circuits (e.g., striatum encodes losses more strongly than gains), (2) engagement of distinct neural systems for losses vs. gains (e.g., loss-specific circuits), (3) differential weighting of loss and gain signals during value integration, or (4) a combination of these mechanisms. Without identifying the precise neural pathway, we cannot develop interventions to reduce maladaptive loss aversion (e.g., in pathological gambling) or understand why loss aversion varies across individuals and contexts.

---

#### **단계 4: Research Opportunity**

> We use a combination of high-resolution fMRI, computational modeling of choice behavior, and pharmacological manipulation (dopamine agonist vs. placebo) to test whether loss aversion emerges from **asymmetric dopamine signaling in the striatum during loss vs. gain encoding**. We hypothesize that losses trigger stronger dopaminergic responses than equivalent gains, creating an asymmetric value signal that drives loss-averse choices. If confirmed, this mechanism would: (1) explain why loss aversion is so robust across contexts (fundamental valuation asymmetry), (2) predict individual differences in loss aversion based on baseline dopamine function, and (3) suggest targeted interventions (e.g., dopaminergic modulation) for reducing maladaptive loss aversion in clinical populations.

> Traditionally, most research has conceptualized persistence as an individual endeavor, focusing on internal causes and correlates of persistence in creating interventions to help students persevere.

> Despite this focus on bolstering internal beliefs, knowledge, and skills to help students persevere, persistence is the product of not only individual processes but also relational ones.

**주제**: Early Childhood Intervention - Mechanisms of Long-term Effects

---

#### **단계 1: Established Knowledge**

> Early childhood intervention programs have demonstrated remarkable short-term effects on cognitive development, academic achievement, and social-emotional skills (57, 58). Meta-analyses of programs like Head Start, Perry Preschool, and Abecedarian show medium-to-large effect sizes (d=0.4-0.8) on IQ, school readiness, and behavioral outcomes during the intervention period and immediately following (59, 60). These effects are well-documented across diverse populations and program types, establishing early intervention as an evidence-based approach to promoting child development (61, 62). The mechanisms underlying short-term gains are relatively well-understood: high-quality programs provide enriched learning environments, responsive caregiving, and structured activities that directly target cognitive and social-emotional skills (63, 64).

---

#### **단계 2: Emerging Challenges**

> However, a critical translational gap exists: **the mechanisms through which early intervention produces long-term effects (into adolescence and adulthood) remain largely unknown**. While some programs show persistent effects on outcomes like high school graduation, college attendance, and adult earnings (65, 66), others show "fade-out" where initial gains diminish over time (67, 68). This variability is puzzling because programs with similar short-term effects show dramatically different long-term trajectories. Moreover, we do not understand *why* some early interventions produce lasting changes while others do not—whether this reflects: (a) differences in program quality or intensity, (b) differences in the skills or capacities targeted, (c) differences in follow-up support or environmental continuity, or (d) interactions between program characteristics and child/family factors.

#### **단계 3: Critical Gap**

> The field lacks a theoretical framework that can explain **which early intervention components produce durable, long-term effects and through what mechanisms these effects persist**. Specifically, we do not know: (1) whether long-term effects are mediated by changes in foundational cognitive capacities (e.g., executive function, self-regulation) that support later learning, (2) whether they reflect changes in environmental factors (e.g., parent behavior, school quality) that maintain gains, (3) whether they emerge from early skill advantages that compound over time (snowball effects), or (4) whether they require specific combinations of program components and individual characteristics. Without understanding these mechanisms, we cannot design interventions that maximize long-term impact or predict which children will benefit most from early programs.

---

#### **단계 4: Research Opportunity**

> We propose a **"cascading mechanisms" framework** that posits early interventions produce long-term effects through multiple, interacting pathways: (1) direct skill acquisition that provides early advantages, (2) changes in foundational capacities (executive function, self-regulation) that support ongoing learning, and (3) environmental changes (parent behavior, teacher expectations) that maintain and amplify gains. Using a 15-year longitudinal study of an early intervention program (N=500, followed from age 3 to 18) combined with annual assessments of cognitive skills, academic achievement, parent behavior, and school quality, we test whether executive function at age 6 mediates the relationship between early intervention and adolescent outcomes, and whether parent engagement and school quality moderate this pathway. By identifying the mechanisms of long-term impact, our findings will inform: (1) design of early interventions that maximize durability, (2) identification of children who need additional support to maintain gains, and (3) policy decisions about resource allocation for early vs. later interventions.

#### **단계 1: Established Knowledge (확립된 지식)**

> Although women nowadays outnumber men in higher education, they remain strongly underrepresented in math-intensive fields (1, 2). This underrepresentation is a source of concern for two main reasons: It contributes substantially to gender inequality in the labor market, and it represents a loss of potential talent that could in particular help meeting the growing demand of skills related to the development of information technology and artificial intelligence (1–6).

---

#### **단계 2: Emerging Challenges (새로운 도전) - Paradox 제시**

> Despite these concerns, the underrepresentation of women in math-intensive fields has remained constant or even increased in most developed countries during the past two decades (7). **This underrepresentation is also more pronounced in more developed countries (8–10) and in countries that are more gender equal in terms of economic and political opportunities and rights (10), a pattern that has been named the "gender-equality paradox" (10).**

> Similar cross-country paradoxical relationships have been found with a large range of other gender gaps: more gender-egalitarian (in the sense of the Global Gender Gap Index [GGGI], which essentially captures "vertical" or "traditional" gender equality; see details below), and wealthier countries also experience higher gender gaps in basic preferences measured through laboratory experiment (11), cognitive abilities such as spatial visualization (12), self-reported personality traits (13), basic human values (14), self-esteem (15), subjective well-being (16), or depression (17). These associations have led scholars to question gender socialization theories and the gender stratification model (9, 18) according to which gender gaps in interest, performance, and choices are mainly the result of gender gaps in status and opportunities. It has been argued in particular that the gender stratification model fails to account for the fact that countries renowned for gender equality show some of the largest sex differences in interest in and pursuit of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) degrees (19).

- ✅ **이론적 도전**: "gender stratification model fails to account for"

---

#### **단계 3: Critical Gap (핵심 공백)**

> A common explanation put forward in some recent literature for the gender-equality paradox is that in more equal and developed countries, girls and boys have more freedom and ease to express their intrinsically distinct inner preferences and interests (10–12). This explanation gets its theoretical foundations from the tradition of evolutionary psychology, which posits the existence of innate gender differences in, e.g., personality or interests (20).

**분석**:

- ✅ **기존 설명 제시**: 진화심리학적 설명 (innate differences)
- ✅ **대안 필요성 암시**: "could also be explained" - 다른 설명 가능성

#### **단계 4: Research Opportunity (연구 기회)**

> In this contribution, in line with a strand of research in sociology, initiated by Charles and coworkers, relating horizontal educational and occupational segregation to gender essentialism (8, 9, 21, 22), **we show that the gender-equality paradox could also be explained by differences across countries in culturally constructed gender identities.** To this aim, we build a country-level measure of the gender essentialist norm that "math is not for girls," we show that this measure is larger in more developed and more egalitarian countries, and we establish that it can mediate the paradoxical relationship between economic development or traditional gender equality and the underrepresentation of women in math-related fields.

> To discuss the mechanisms connecting socioeconomic development or traditional gender equality to gender essentialism, we rely on previous research that highlights the multidimensional nature of gender equality (9, 23–26) and allows us to suggest possible explanations for the fact that more developed countries that are more gender egalitarian in terms of rights (as measured by the GGGI) can exhibit stronger gender norms, as well as gender inequalities in dimensions such as female representation in math-related fields. We focus primarily on mathematics, as the underrepresentation of women in STEM is large mostly in math-related fields (mathematics, physics, computer science, and engineering).

### 예제 4.2: 사회심리학 - 성별 차이와 성별 유사성의 모순 (가상 예제)

**저널**: Nature Human Behaviour
**주제**: Gender Differences in Cognitive Abilities - Resolving the Paradox

---

#### **단계 1: Established Knowledge**

> Research on gender differences in cognitive abilities has produced a complex and sometimes contradictory literature. Meta-analyses consistently show that men, on average, outperform women on spatial rotation tasks (d=0.5-0.7) and mental rotation (d=0.6-0.8), while women, on average, outperform men on verbal fluency (d=0.3-0.4) and episodic memory (d=0.2-0.3) (69, 70). These differences are well-replicated across cultures and age groups, suggesting robust, though modest, population-level differences (71, 72). Neuroimaging studies have identified corresponding neural differences, including larger parietal regions in men (associated with spatial processing) and larger temporal regions in women (associated with verbal processing) (73, 74). The prevailing explanation has been that these differences reflect evolved, biologically-based specializations that emerged from different selection pressures on males and females (75, 76).

---

#### **단계 2: Emerging Challenges**

> However, this account is challenged by a striking paradox: **despite consistent mean differences, the distributions of cognitive abilities show massive overlap between genders, with 95%+ of individuals showing abilities within the range of the other gender** (77, 78). Moreover, studies examining within-gender variability reveal that gender accounts for only 1-5% of variance in cognitive abilities, while individual differences within each gender account for 95%+ of variance (79, 80). This creates a fundamental contradiction: how can there be "robust" gender differences if most men and women are more similar to each other than different? Additionally, cross-cultural studies show that gender differences vary dramatically across societies—being larger in more gender-egalitarian countries and smaller in more traditional societies—contradicting a purely biological explanation (81, 82).

---

#### **단계 3: Critical Gap**

> This paradox raises a critical question: **What explains the coexistence of consistent mean differences and massive distributional overlap in gender-related cognitive abilities?** The field lacks a theoretical framework that can reconcile: (1) why small mean differences (d=0.2-0.8) are considered "robust" when they explain minimal variance, (2) whether these differences reflect biological factors, environmental factors, or their interaction, (3) why gender differences vary across cultures if they are biologically-based, and (4) what mechanisms produce the large within-gender variability that dwarfs between-gender differences. Without resolving this paradox, we cannot understand the true nature of gender differences, predict individual abilities, or design interventions that address gender-related disparities in STEM fields.

---

#### **단계 4: Research Opportunity**

> We propose a **"multifactorial interaction" framework** that posits gender differences emerge from complex interactions between: (a) small biological factors (hormonal, neural) that create mean differences, (b) large environmental factors (stereotypes, opportunities, expectations) that amplify or suppress these differences, and (c) individual differences (genetic, experiential) that create massive within-gender variability. Using a large-scale study (N=10,000) combining genetic data, neuroimaging, longitudinal behavioral assessments, and cultural context measures, we test whether: (1) biological factors predict mean differences but not individual differences, (2) environmental factors (gender stereotypes, educational opportunities) moderate the expression of biological differences, and (3) the interaction between biological and environmental factors explains both the consistency of mean differences and the variability of individual outcomes. By resolving this paradox, our findings will inform: (1) understanding of true gender differences vs. stereotypes, (2) interventions to reduce gender disparities in STEM, and (3) personalized approaches that consider individual variability rather than group averages.
