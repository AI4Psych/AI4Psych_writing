# Introduction

Prejudice fragments societies and undermines the social cohesion that diverse communities need to thrive. When people harbor negative attitudes toward other groups, these biases fuel discrimination, perpetuate inequality, and erode the trust essential for peaceful coexistence (Allport, 1954; Dovidio et al., 2010; Paluck & Green, 2009). As globalization continues reshaping demographic landscapes worldwide, developing effective interventions to reduce prejudice becomes increasingly urgent.

## The Promise of Intergroup Contact

The most powerful tool we have for combating prejudice lies in bringing different groups together under the right conditions. When people from different backgrounds interact as equals while working toward shared goals with institutional support, prejudicial attitudes consistently weaken (Allport, 1954). This contact hypothesis has generated remarkable empirical support: analysis of 515 studies involving over 700,000 participants reveals robust prejudice reduction effects across diverse populations and contexts (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006).

The psychological mechanisms driving these changes operate through three interconnected pathways. Contact reduces the anxiety people feel when anticipating interactions with outgroup members, builds empathy by humanizing the "other," and expands knowledge that challenges stereotypical assumptions (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2008). Among these pathways, anxiety reduction emerges as the strongest predictor of attitude change, suggesting that positive emotional experiences fundamentally reshape how we view other groups (Hodson, 2011; Voci & Hewstone, 2003). When group identities remain visible during these positive encounters, attitude improvements extend beyond specific individuals to encompass entire outgroups (Brown & Hewstone, 2005).

Yet implementing contact interventions faces formidable obstacles in practice. Geographic segregation keeps different groups physically separated, while social networks naturally cluster around similarity, creating homogeneous bubbles that rarely intersect (Dixon et al., 2005; McPherson et al., 2001). Structural inequalities compound these barriers by maintaining the very conditions that prevent equal-status contact from occurring naturally.

## Digital Frontiers in Intergroup Contact

Technology offers promising solutions to these traditional constraints. Online platforms transcend geographic boundaries and can facilitate meaningful encounters between groups that might never meet in person. Digital contact interventions demonstrate significant prejudice reduction effects, though somewhat smaller than face-to-face interactions (d = 0.38 versus higher in-person effects) (Lemmer & Wagner, 2015). These platforms create unique advantages: they reduce initial anxiety through anonymity options, enable careful control of contact conditions, and provide access to diverse interaction partners regardless of local demographics (Amichai-Hamburger & McKenna, 2006; White et al., 2021).

Real-world applications validate this digital approach. Structured online dialogues between conflicting groups have successfully reduced prejudice in Northern Ireland and Israeli-Palestinian contexts, demonstrating that meaningful contact can occur across digital mediums (Gaertner et al., 2008; Ellis & Maoz, 2007). However, the medium itself proves neutral—poorly designed interventions can actually increase prejudice rather than reduce it (Barlow et al., 2012; Mazziotta et al., 2011).

Social media platforms illustrate this double-edged potential. While these environments theoretically enable cross-group interaction, they often create echo chambers that reinforce existing biases and facilitate hostile encounters that damage intergroup relations (Bail et al., 2018; Geschke et al., 2019). Success requires intentional design that promotes positive contact while minimizing opportunities for negative experiences.

## The Emergence of AI-Mediated Contact

Artificial intelligence introduces entirely new possibilities for contact interventions. Modern conversational AI systems engage in sophisticated, contextually appropriate dialogues that increasingly resemble human interaction (Brown et al., 2020; Ouyang et al., 2022). This technological advancement raises a fascinating question: can AI systems effectively represent outgroup members in contact scenarios?

Early evidence suggests intriguing parallels between human and artificial prejudice patterns. AI systems exhibit biases that mirror human intergroup prejudices, showing systematic discrimination against marginalized groups and replicating empathy gaps that characterize human intergroup relations (Tamkin et al., 2023; Wan et al., 2023; Hofmann et al., 2024). These findings reveal both the challenge and opportunity in AI-mediated contact interventions.

The challenge lies in AI systems' tendency to perpetuate existing prejudices without careful design and training (Singh et al., 2024; Hofmann et al., 2022). However, this same susceptibility to bias suggests that AI systems might also be amenable to the same contact principles that reduce prejudice in humans. Preliminary research supports this possibility: when language models experience simulated positive intergroup contact scenarios, their representations of stigmatized groups improve significantly (Kumar et al., 2024).

This bidirectional relationship between contact and AI bias suggests that chatbots might serve as effective mediators for human prejudice reduction. Unlike human interaction partners, AI systems offer unlimited availability, perfect consistency in implementing contact conditions, and freedom from the practical constraints that limit traditional interventions.

## Social Presence and Human-AI Interaction

The effectiveness of chatbot-mediated contact depends critically on how users perceive these artificial agents. Social presence theory reveals that communication mediums vary dramatically in their ability to convey the sense that real people participate in interactions (Short et al., 1976; Biocca et al., 2003). Users respond fundamentally differently to agents they perceive as human-controlled versus computer-controlled, affecting both engagement quality and the potential for social influence (Hoegen et al., 2019; Lombard & Ditton, 1997).

Anthropomorphic characteristics enhance these social responses. When chatbots display human-like qualities, users demonstrate increased empathy and engagement, suggesting deeper psychological investment in the interaction (Epley et al., 2007; Waytz et al., 2010). This anthropomorphization must balance against ethical concerns about transparency and the potential for deceptive practices in human-AI interaction (Floridi et al., 2018).

Design elements significantly influence user perceptions and behaviors. Profile photographs and names shape impression formation from the first moment of contact, potentially activating the social categorization processes necessary for intergroup contact effects (Todorov et al., 2005; Walther et al., 2008). The interaction framework itself—whether cooperative or competitive—may differentially activate contact mechanisms and influence attitudes toward artificial agents (Dovidio et al., 2003; Johnson & Johnson, 2005; de Graaf & Allouch, 2013).

## The Korean Context

South Korea provides an ideal laboratory for examining these AI-mediated contact interventions. The country has experienced rapid demographic transformation, with foreign residents increasing from 550,000 in 2006 to over 2.5 million in 2023 (Statistics Korea, 2023). Despite this growing diversity, public attitudes toward multiculturalism remain ambivalent, with Korea scoring below the OECD average on multicultural acceptance measures (OECD, 2019).

Existing prejudice reduction efforts in Korea emphasize cognitive approaches that target knowledge and awareness (Kim & Park, 2018; Lee & Cho, 2019). While these educational interventions show modest effectiveness, they fail to address the emotional dimensions that drive sustained attitude change (Tropp & Pettigrew, 2005). This cognitive focus leaves critical gaps in understanding how emotional mediators like intergroup anxiety and empathy might reduce prejudice among Korean populations.

Korea's technological landscape makes it particularly suitable for testing innovative digital interventions. High digital connectivity rates and positive attitudes toward AI adoption suggest that Korean participants may readily engage with chatbot-mediated approaches (Kim et al., 2020). The widespread use of mobile platforms creates a natural environment for implementing and scaling such interventions.

## Present Study

This research investigates whether meaningful contact with AI chatbots representing outgroup members can reduce racial prejudice among Korean participants. We examine whether positive chatbot interactions decrease prejudicial attitudes through the same psychological mechanisms that drive traditional contact effects: reduced intergroup anxiety and increased empathy.

Three critical design factors structure our investigation. Chatbot nationality compares European versus Southeast Asian representatives, examining groups that differ in social status and stereotyping within Korean society. Profile information contrasts anonymous interactions with those featuring names and photographs, addressing questions about social presence and anthropomorphization. Interaction context implements cooperative versus competitive conversation frameworks, testing whether optimal contact conditions enhance intervention effectiveness.

This investigation extends intergroup contact theory into the digital age while addressing practical needs for scalable prejudice reduction interventions. By examining the psychological mechanisms underlying human-AI contact and identifying optimal design factors, this research provides both theoretical insights and practical guidance for developing AI-mediated approaches to prejudice reduction in diverse societies.
