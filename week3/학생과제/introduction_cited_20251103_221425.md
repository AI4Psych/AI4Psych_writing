# Introduction

Mental health conditions, substance use disorders, and suicidal behaviors represent interconnected public health crises, contributing immensely to the global burden of disease and mortality [1] (Whiteford et al., 2013; Prince et al., 2007; Rehm et al., 2017). Recognizing their pervasive population-level impact, these complex issues necessitate integrated health approaches and a deep understanding of their intricate relationships. The theoretical landscape for comprehending these challenges is underpinned by several key frameworks. The Public Health Model and Global Burden of Disease (GBD) framework establishes mental and substance use disorders as major contributors to global disability, underscoring the need for population-level interventions. Complementing this, the Multifactorial Risk Factor Model posits that outcomes such as suicide and self-harm, often mediated by mental health and substance use, arise from a complex interplay of individual, social, environmental, and clinical factors [2] (Webster, 2017; Bozzini et al., 2021). Furthermore, Developmental Psychopathology and Longitudinal Risk theories highlight the critical importance of developmental stages and temporal relationships in the emergence and progression of substance use, mental health issues, and suicidal behaviors across the life course [3] (Gobbi et al., 2019; Miranda-Mendizabal et al., 2019; Auger et al., 2022).

Prior research has firmly established strong correlations between substance engagement, mental health conditions, and self-inflicted harm. For instance, alcohol use is consistently linked to an increased risk of suicide [4] (Isaacs et al., 2022), and various substances are known to influence distinct mental health outcomes [5] (Webster, 2017; Gobbi et al., 2019). Studies have identified a wide array of individual-level risk factors (e.g., pre-existing mental health conditions, genetic predispositions) and broader ecological factors (e.g., socioeconomic status, policy environments) that contribute to these adverse outcomes, aligning with the Multifactorial Risk Factor Model. The field has progressed significantly from merely documenting the widespread prevalence and burden of these disorders to identifying their complex, multifactorial etiologies. Initially, the focus was on establishing static associations between individual risk factors and outcomes; however, there has been a critical shift towards understanding the *dynamics* of these relationships, moving from cross-sectional correlations to longitudinal investigations. This progression has been driven by the recognition that these are not isolated conditions but rather dynamically interacting phenomena that unfold over an individual's life course within a broader socio-ecological context.

Currently, we recognize that mental health, substance use, and self-inflicted harm are profoundly intertwined public health challenges with global implications. Their development and progression are understood to be multifactorial, influenced by a complex web of individual vulnerabilities, social disparities, and environmental determinants. There is a growing appreciation for the importance of developmental stages and temporal sequencing in understanding risk trajectories. However, despite this progress, critical debates persist regarding the precise causal pathways and directionality of these relationships [6] (Gobbi et al., 2019), the general versus specific effects of different substances and patterns of use [7] (Webster, 2017; Striley et al., 2022), and the relative contributions and interactions of individual versus ecological factors in shaping risk [8] (Matthay et al., 2021; Rockett et al., 2022). Much of the existing literature, while identifying strong correlations, often presents a somewhat static view, lacking comprehensive, dynamic, longitudinal evidence that fully accounts for the evolving patterns and multifactorial modulation of these complex pathways across diverse populations. This limitation leaves several critical research gaps unaddressed, including a lack of dynamic, longitudinal understanding of substance-mental health-self-harm pathways; limited disaggregation of multifactorial risk by individual and contextual moderators; underrepresentation of comprehensive population-level evidence from specific national contexts; and insufficient focus on the nuanced effects of moderate substance engagement patterns.

This study is therefore crucial to address these pressing needs, moving beyond static correlations to offer a nuanced, population-level understanding of these complex relationships within a unique East Asian context. This leads directly to two core conceptual research questions. First, *how do evolving patterns of substance engagement dynamically interact with mental health trajectories to influence the risk of self-inflicted harm?* This question is pivotal for advancing theoretical understanding beyond static correlations, confronting debates regarding causality and directionality, and emphasizing the importance of temporal sequencing and the evolving nature of risk factors over the life course. Leveraging a large-scale, national, retrospective longitudinal cohort design from the South Korean National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) database, this study can identify and analyze evolving patterns of alcohol consumption and smoking status, track the trajectories of mental health diagnoses (via outpatient visits and drug prescriptions), and observe their temporal relationships with the subsequent incidence of severe self-inflicted harm. This uniquely allows for an empirical investigation into whether changes in substance engagement precede changes in mental health, or vice versa, at a population level, thereby offering a window into differential mechanisms of mutual influence and progression over time.

Second, *to what extent do inherent individual attributes and broader contextual environments differentially modulate the interplay between substance engagement, mental well-being, and vulnerability to severe self-harm outcomes?* This question addresses the complexity of multifactorial risk by positing that the relationship between substance engagement, mental well-being, and self-harm is not universal but is profoundly shaped by mediating and moderating factors, thereby contributing to debates on the conceptual contributions and interactions of micro-level and macro-level factors. The study explicitly addresses this by incorporating a rich array of individual attributes (age, gender, extensive pre-existing health profiles including comorbidities like ALD, COPD, CVD, obesity, and CCI scores) and a crucial contextual factor (income quartiles). The large, representative national cohort enables robust subgroup analyses and the statistical modeling of interaction effects, allowing this research to empirically demonstrate *how* specific demographic and health characteristics, alongside socioeconomic conditions, amplify or buffer the impact of substance engagement on mental well-being and self-harm risk. Furthermore, by utilizing the comprehensive NHIS database in South Korea, the study provides invaluable population-level evidence from a non-Western, high-income Asian context, contributing significantly to the global understanding of these public health challenges beyond predominantly Western findings, and allowing for investigation into the nuanced effects of mild-to-moderate substance engagement patterns. Ultimately, this research aims to provide critical insights into the dynamic, multifactorial, and context-dependent pathways leading to self-inflicted harm, thereby informing more targeted and effective public health interventions.
