Working memory is a critical component of human cognition, functioning as a dynamic system for temporarily storing and manipulating information essential for complex cognitive tasks, such as language comprehension, problem-solving, and planning (D’Esposito & Postle, 2015; Cowan, 2014). Its significance is underscored by its impact on various mental disorders, including schizophrenia, ADHD, and depression, where deficits can severely impair cognitive functioning (Goldman-Rakic, 1994; Kofler et al., 2011). Consequently, elucidating the neural substrates and mechanisms underpinning working memory remains a pivotal focus in cognitive neuroscience and clinical research.

The prefrontal cortex (PFC) has been extensively studied for its role in working memory, with lesion studies and functional MRI consistently highlighting its involvement in maintaining temporary information (Pribram et al., 1964; Curtis & D’Esposito, 2003). However, recent advancements in neuroimaging techniques, such as multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA), suggest that working memory information is distributed across sensory regions, indicating a more complex neural network than previously understood (Harrison & Tong, 2009; Serences et al., 2009; Christophel et al., 2012; Riggall & Postle, 2012). This distributed model posits that while the PFC orchestrates attention and cognitive resources, sensory-specific areas actively retain working memory content.

Emerging theories propose a hierarchical network model for working memory, extending from sensory cortices to the PFC, with each region contributing based on the abstraction level of information (Christophel et al., 2017). The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is identified as a crucial node in this network, supporting high-level working memory processing across modalities (Todd & Marois, 2004; Christophel et al., 2017; Schmidt & Blankenburg, 2018; Kwak & Curtis, 2022). Our preliminary research further suggests that the superior parietal cortex (SPC) plays a significant role in forming supramodal memory representations, particularly in tactile and visual working memory tasks (Park et al., 2025).

Effective working memory operation in dynamic environments necessitates robust resistance to external distractors, a function attributed to higher-order brain areas that regulate attention and cognitive control. The SPC, with its capacity to maintain abstract representations resistant to specific sensory distractions, may sustain generalized memory content while mitigating interference from irrelevant stimuli (Bettencourt & Xu, 2016; Lorenc et al., 2018; Deutsch et al., 2023). However, the causal role of the SPC in distraction resistance remains inadequately explored due to the limitations of fMRI in establishing direct causal links.

To address this gap, our study employs transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to modulate SPC activity during working memory tasks involving distractors. TMS offers a unique advantage by allowing for the non-invasive manipulation of neural activity, thereby providing causal insights into brain function. Previous TMS studies have predominantly focused on the PFC's contribution to working memory (Hamidi et al., 2008; Mackey & Curtis, 2017), with limited exploration of the SPC's role in attention and distraction resistance. Our study seeks to fill this void by assessing changes in working memory performance when TMS is applied to the SPC during tasks with and without distractors.

This research is further distinguished by its methodological innovations. By integrating structural MRI and fMRI data, we aim to refine TMS targeting, potentially revealing individual differences in neural responses. This approach not only enhances the precision of stimulation but also contributes to a more nuanced understanding of the SPC's role in working memory. Additionally, our study addresses the limitations of TMS, such as its spatial resolution and the variability in individual brain anatomy, by employing advanced neuroimaging techniques to guide stimulation parameters.

The implications of this research extend beyond basic neuroscience, offering potential advancements in clinical applications. By elucidating the neural mechanisms of working memory and distraction resistance, our findings could inform intervention strategies for cognitive deficits associated with neurological conditions. Moreover, the integration of behavioral and neuroimaging paradigms promises to enhance our understanding of the brain's working memory systems and the mechanisms enabling cognitive resilience amid sensory distractions.
