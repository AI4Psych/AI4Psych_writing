Working memory is a central component of cognitive functionality, responsible for the transient holding and manipulation of information to support complex reasoning and purposeful behavior [Cowan, 2014]. It is essential for various high-level cognitive tasks including language processing, problem-solving, and planning. Dysfunctions in working memory are commonly associated with psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia, ADHD, and depression, emphasizing its clinical importance [Goldman-Rakic, 1994; Kofler et al., 2011]. Thus, investigating the neural mechanisms underlying working memory remains a focus in both cognitive neuroscience and clinical research.

Historical analyses of patients with damage to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) reveal significant impairments in working memory maintenance, highlighting the PFC as a critical neural substrate [Pribram et al., 1964]. Functional MRI studies further indicate persistent PFC activation during working memory tasks, suggesting its role in regulating attention and control rather than mere storage [Curtis & D’Esposito, 2003]. However, recent multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) research shows that sensory areas instead may retain the encoded information during working memory tasks, casting doubt on the PFC's role in storage [Harrison & Tong, 2009; Riggall & Postle, 2012]. 

A reconciliatory perspective posits a distributed network model, wherein the complexity of information abstraction determines its representation ranging from the sensory cortex to the PFC [Christophel et al., 2017]. The posterior parietal cortex (PPC), along with the PFC, figures prominently in this network, supporting the maintenance of abstract information representations. Studies via MVPA disclose the ability to decode information not only from sensory cortices but also from the PPC, reinforcing its integrative role in working memory [Christophel et al., 2017; Schmidt & Blankenburg, 2018].

In realistic scenarios, working memory must resist distraction while sustaining target information, a task predominantly assigned to higher cognitive areas involved in attentional regulation and inhibitory control. The PPC, particularly, is implicated in maintaining abstract representations resilient to sensory interference [Bettencourt & Xu, 2016]. Studies indicate that working memory representations in the PPC remain stable even in the presence of distractors, while those in sensory regions are disrupted, advocating for a role in generalizing memory content rather than specific sensory detail processing [Lorenc et al., 2018; Deutsch et al., 2023]. 

Despite these insights, conclusively defining the causal implication of PPC in managing distractions within working memory using fMRI alone is challenging. Thus, our study leverages transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to probe the causal relationship of the PPC in working memory, particularly under distraction [Liu et al., 2024]. While explorations into TMS to test working memory usually emphasize the PFC, a direct inspection of the PPC's role in distraction resistance is lacking [Hamidi et al., 2008]. We aim to fill this gap by applying TMS to the superior parietal cortex in varying task conditions to observe consequent changes in working memory performance. Structural MRI and fMRI data will refine our understanding of individual anatomical variance and stimulation effects, paving the way for advancements in targeted cognitive interventions.
