**Introduction to the Main Topic**

In the intricate network of the human brain, the Superior Parietal Cortex (SPC) plays a crucial role in cognitive functions, particularly in working memory and sensory integration. Situated in the posterior part of the brain, the SPC is pivotal in modulating attention and facilitating the retention of information across multiple sensory modalities—a phenomenon known as supra-modal memory. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of this process is essential, as working memory is foundational to higher-order cognitive functions such as problem-solving and planning. The intricate dynamics between neural circuits in the SPC and their role in memory retention and attentional control continue to captivate neuroscience researchers seeking to delineate the brain's complex functions.

Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has emerged as a powerful tool for exploring causal relationships between neural activity and cognitive processes. By delivering magnetic pulses to targeted brain regions, TMS can transiently disrupt neural activity, offering insights into the functioning and connectivity of specific areas. In the context of working memory, researchers have used TMS to investigate its effects on tasks requiring the retention and manipulation of information. Interruptions or enhancements in cognitive performance, resulting from TMS application, elucidate the contributions of specific brain regions, such as the SPC, to working memory. Given the presence of distractors and other challenges to cognitive load, understanding how the SPC manages such disruptions can enhance our knowledge of cognitive resilience and adaptability in an ever-changing environment.

**Current Research Trends**

Research in cognitive neuroscience increasingly focuses on the intersections between brain stimulation techniques and cognitive processes. For instance, Liu et al. (2024) demonstrated that high-frequency repetitive TMS (rTMS) has broad ameliorating effects on working memory among stroke patients, suggesting potential therapeutic applications. Similarly, studies by Arciniega et al. (2018) found that frontoparietal transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) could benefit visual working memory in older adults, highlighting age-related considerations in memory retention.

Moreover, functional connectivity research reveals intriguing insights into the SPC's role. Hwang et al. (2020) showed that the human intraparietal sulcus—part of the parietal cortex—modulates task-evoked functional connectivity, thereby influencing working memory performance. Such studies underscore the importance of the SPC in modulating information processing across tasks with varying cognitive demands. Additionally, Romei et al. (2011) linked distinct brain frequencies to global versus local visual processing through rhythmic TMS over the parietal cortex, emphasizing the SPC's involvement in perceptual dimensions of cognitive processing.

The application of TMS has also shed light on specific and nonspecific neural activities during working memory tasks. Oh and Leung (2010) examined the cortical underpinnings involved in processing visual representations, underscoring the interplay between selective attention and memory retention. This growing body of research illustrates a thematic focus on understanding the interactions between brain stimulation, neural connectivity, and cognitive function.

**Research Gap**

Despite the considerable advances in understanding the SPC's role in cognitive functions, several unresolved questions remain. The precise causal pathways linking supra-modal memory retention to SPC activity, especially under conditions involving distractors, require further elucidation. Existing studies often focus on isolated aspects of working memory or employ uniform experimental conditions, neglecting the complexities of multi-modal interference and cognitive distractors that individuals encounter in real-world settings. Furthermore, while TMS offers a non-invasive means to probe these neural circuits, there is limited consensus on its effects' variability across different cognitive tasks and contexts.

This gap is particularly pertinent in creating more effective therapeutic approaches for cognitive impairments. As highlighted by Proskovec et al. (2018), oscillatory dynamics in the prefrontal and superior temporal cortices correlate with spatial working memory performance, yet the precise mechanisms by which the SPC modulates these dynamics remain inadequately explored. Addressing these limitations is crucial for developing more sophisticated models of cognitive functioning and targeted interventions.

**Need for the Current Study**

The present study aims to address these gaps by investigating the causal relationship between supra-modal memory retention and SPC activity through the lens of TMS application. By specifically examining working memory performance in the presence or absence of distractors, this research seeks to unravel the nuanced interactions within the SPC and its influence on cognitive resilience. The use of TMS provides a unique opportunity to causally probe these relationships, offering insights into both the normative functioning and potential dysregulation observed in clinical populations.

With these objectives, the study aspires to contribute a more comprehensive understanding of the SPC's role in cognitive processing, bridging the divide between theoretical neuroscience and practical applications. Highlighting the factors that influence working memory amidst cognitive challenges may inform strategies to enhance cognitive health and performance across diverse populations, positioning this research at the forefront of innovative interventions aimed at optimizing brain function.

By addressing these aims, this study not only enhances our theoretical understanding of cognitive neuroscience but also endeavors to have tangible impacts on the methodologies employed to assess and support cognitive functions in real-world scenarios. This research promises to deepen the scientific community's comprehension of complex neural processes, positioning itself as a critical contribution to the ongoing pursuit of cognitive enhancement and rehabilitation.
