Working memory is integral to cognitive function, facilitating the temporary retention and manipulation of information necessary for complex reasoning and purposeful behavior (Cowan, 2014). It underpins various high-level cognitive tasks, including language processing, problem-solving, and planning. Dysfunctional working memory is often linked to psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia, ADHD, and depression, underscoring its clinical relevance (Goldman-Rakic, 1994; Kofler et al., 2011). Consequently, understanding the neural mechanisms underpinning working memory remains a focal point in cognitive neuroscience and clinical research.

Historical analyses of patients with prefrontal cortex (PFC) damage reveal significant impairments in working memory maintenance, indicating the PFC's critical involvement (Pribram et al., 1964). Functional MRI studies further demonstrate sustained PFC activation during working memory tasks, suggesting its role in attention regulation and control rather than solely in storage (Curtis & D’Esposito, 2003). In contrast, recent multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) research suggests that sensory areas may actually retain the encoded information during working memory tasks, challenging the PFC's traditional role as a storage site (Harrison & Tong, 2009; Riggall & Postle, 2012).

A reconciliatory perspective proposes a distributed network model, wherein the complexity of information abstraction dictates its representation from sensory cortex to PFC (Christophel et al., 2017). Within this network, the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) plays a significant role alongside the PFC, supporting the maintenance of abstract information representations. MVPA studies confirm that information can be decoded not only from sensory cortices but also from the PPC, underscoring its integrative function in working memory (Christophel et al., 2017; Schmidt & Blankenburg, 2018).

In real-world contexts, working memory must resist distractions while sustaining target information, a function predominantly managed by higher cognitive areas involved in attentional regulation and inhibitory control. The PPC is particularly implicated in maintaining abstract representations resilient to sensory interference (Bettencourt & Xu, 2016). Evidence indicates that working memory representations in the PPC remain stable despite distractors, while those in sensory regions are disrupted, suggesting its role in generalizing memory content rather than processing specific sensory details (Lorenc et al., 2018; Deutsch et al., 2023).

Definitively determining the PPC's causal role in managing distractions within working memory using fMRI alone presents challenges. To address this, our study employs transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to investigate the PPC's causal involvement in working memory, particularly under distraction (Liu et al., 2024). Although TMS studies traditionally focus on the PFC, direct examination of the PPC's role in distraction resistance is scarce (Hamidi et al., 2008). We aim to address this gap by applying TMS to the superior parietal cortex under various task conditions to assess changes in working memory performance. Structural MRI and fMRI data will enhance our understanding of individual anatomical variation and the effects of stimulation, paving the way for targeted cognitive interventions.
