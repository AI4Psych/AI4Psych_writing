**Introduction to the Main Topic**

The Superior Parietal Cortex (SPC) is a critical region of the human brain involved in multiple cognitive functions, particularly focusing on working memory and sensory integration. Located in the posterior part of the brain, the SPC plays an essential role in modulating attention and supporting the retention of information across different sensory modalities, a process referred to as supra-modal memory. Comprehending the mechanisms of this process is vital, as working memory forms the foundation for higher-order cognitive functions such as problem-solving and planning. Recent advancements in neuroscience are increasingly centered on elucidating the interactions between the SPC's neural circuits and their role in memory retention and attentional control, enhancing our understanding of the brain's complex functionality.

Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has become a significant investigative tool in exploring the causal relationships between neural activity and cognitive processes. This non-invasive technique involves delivering magnetic pulses to specific brain regions, allowing researchers to observe changes in neural activity and, subsequently, cognitive performance. In the context of working memory, TMS has been employed to explore its effects on tasks that require retaining and manipulating information. By analyzing alterations in cognitive performance due to TMS application, such as those that affect the SPC, researchers gain insights into how targeted disruptions in neural activity can influence working memory. Understanding the SPC’s role in managing distractions and cognitive load presents a valuable opportunity for enhancing our comprehension of cognitive resilience in dynamic environments.

**Current Research Trends**

Cognitive neuroscience research is increasingly focused on the interplay between brain stimulation techniques and cognitive processes, with particular attention on the SPC’s role. For instance, Liu et al. (2024) explored the methodological implications of high-frequency repetitive TMS (rTMS) in studying working memory, highlighting its broader effects on specific brain functions. Such research underscores TMS's potential in revealing the underlying processes that govern working memory, irrespective of any therapeutic applications it may have for conditions like stroke.

Further investigations into the functional connectivity of the SPC are yielding intriguing insights. Hwang et al. (2020) illustrated that the intraparietal sulcus—a part of the parietal cortex—modulates task-evoked functional connectivity, influencing working memory performance. Such findings emphasize the SPC's importance in processing information across varying cognitive demands, further broadening our understanding of the brain’s adaptability in different contexts. Additionally, Romei et al. (2011) emphasized the connection between specific brain frequencies and cognitive processing through rhythmic TMS over the parietal cortex, which highlights the SPC's involvement in perceptual aspects of cognition.

Research focused on TMS applications also illuminates the specific neural activities engaged during working memory tasks. Oh and Leung (2010) examined the cortical underpinnings involved in processing visual representations, emphasizing the importance of selective attention in memory retention. This growing body of work accentuates the thematic focus on understanding brain stimulation's relationships with neural connectivity and cognitive functioning, directly tied to the SPC's role in managing working memory amidst distractions.

**Research Gap**

Despite significant advances in recognizing the SPC’s role in cognitive functions, several key questions remain unanswered. Specifically, the precise causal pathways linking supra-modal memory retention to SPC activity, especially in environments filled with distractors, require further exploration. Current studies often examine isolated elements of working memory or operate under uniform experimental conditions, which do not adequately reflect the multifaceted interference and cognitive challenges encountered in real-world environments. While TMS offers an effective means of probing these neural circuits, there is still limited consensus on the variability of its effects across different cognitive tasks and situations.

This gap becomes particularly relevant when considering therapeutic approaches for cognitive impairments. Proskovec et al. (2018) identified that oscillatory dynamics in the prefrontal and superior temporal cortices correlate with spatial working memory performance. However, the mechanisms through which the SPC influences these dynamics have not been sufficiently investigated. Addressing these limitations is essential for developing sophisticated cognitive function models and more effective targeted interventions.

**Need for the Current Study**

This study intends to address the identified gaps by investigating the causal relationship between supra-modal memory retention and SPC activity through the targeted application of TMS. By specifically examining working memory performance in conditions both with and without distractors, this research seeks to elucidate the complex interactions within the SPC and its influence on cognitive resilience. TMS provides a unique opportunity to causally examine these relationships, thereby offering valuable insights into both the brain's normative functioning and potential dysregulation observed in clinical populations.

The study aims to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the SPC's role in cognitive processing, bridging the gap between theoretical neuroscience and practical applications. By highlighting factors that influence working memory in contexts with cognitive challenges, this research may inform strategies to enhance cognitive health and performance across diverse populations. Consequently, the study positions itself at the forefront of innovative interventions aimed at optimizing brain function.

In addressing these objectives, our research endeavors not only to expand theoretical understanding within cognitive neuroscience but also to impact the methodologies employed in assessing and supporting cognitive functions in real-world scenarios. The findings promise to deepen the scientific community’s understanding of complex neural processes, marking this work as a significant contribution to the ongoing pursuit of cognitive enhancement and rehabilitation.
