Working memory is a cognitive system that temporarily stores and manipulates necessary information, even when sensory input is not sustained, performing an essential role in higher-order thinking and goal-oriented behavior [D’Esposito & Postle, 2015]. It serves as the foundation for various cognitive functions such as language comprehension, problem-solving, planning, and inference, and is closely associated with not only everyday life but also learning ability [Cowan, 2014]. Moreover, working memory impairment is commonly observed in mental disorders such as schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and depression [Goldman-Rakic, 1994; Kofler et al., 2011]. Therefore, elucidating the neural mechanisms of working memory is an important task in both cognitive neuroscience and clinical aspects.

Patients with lesions in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) have been observed to have impaired working memory function, and research has shown that the PFC remains active while maintaining working memory, indicating the importance of the PFC as a neural basis for working memory [Pribram et al., 1964; Curtis & D’Esposito, 2003]. However, studies decoding information maintained in working memory from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signal patterns using multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) have reported neural representations of working memory information in sensory areas rather than the PFC [Harrison & Tong, 2009; Serences et al., 2009; Christophel et al., 2012; Riggall & Postle, 2012]. These previous studies suggest that the PFC's role in working memory is to control and regulate attention, while the storage of information is handled by the sensory areas that process the corresponding sensory information. Recently, a perspective has been proposed that combines these claims, suggesting that working memory is distributed across various brain areas from the sensory cortex to the PFC, depending on the level of information abstraction [Christophel et al., 2017].

On the other hand, the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), along with the PFC, is known to play an important role in working memory as a higher-level brain area [Todd & Marois, 2004]. In studies of neural representations of working memory using MVPA, research results have been reported that can decode stimulus information maintained in working memory from the corresponding sensory area and the PPC [Christophel et al., 2017; Schmidt & Blankenburg, 2018; Kwak & Curtis, 2022]. Furthermore, our recent preliminary study directly compared neural representations of working memory for tactile and visual stimuli, confirming that supramodal information representations common to sensory modalities appear in the superior parietal cortex [Park et al., 2025].

For working memory to function effectively in real-world environments, the ability to maintain target information stably while resisting external distractor stimuli is essential. This resistance to distraction is one of the important characteristics of working memory, and the contribution of higher-order brain areas responsible for attention regulation and inhibition is expected to play a significant role. As mentioned earlier, the superior parietal cortex is reported to maintain abstract representations that are not dependent on specific sensory formats, beyond simple storage of sensory information. This suggests that this area may be related to functions that maintain more generalized forms of memory content or protect internal representations from external stimuli, rather than sensory details of stimuli. Indeed, previous studies have shown that while the representation of working memory in the PPC remains relatively stable even when distractor stimuli are presented, the representation in the sensory cortex is affected by distractor stimuli [Bettencourt & Xu, 2016; Lorenc et al., 2018; Deutsch et al., 2023]. However, these results based on previous fMRI experiments alone cannot determine the causal role of these brain areas in certain cognitive processes. Therefore, in this study, we aim to confirm the causal relationship of the resistance to distraction of neural representations in the superior parietal cortex to working memory, using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to non-invasively stimulate specific brain areas and temporarily regulate their activity.

In previous TMS-based working memory studies, changes in working memory performance have been examined mainly through stimulation of the PFC, and some studies have reported stimulation of the parietal lobe [Hamidi et al., 2008; Mackey & Curtis, 2017]. However, no study has clearly elucidated the causal role of the superior parietal lobe in resistance to distraction in working memory situations involving distractor stimuli. Therefore, in this study, we plan to measure changes in working memory performance by applying TMS to the superior parietal cortex while performing a working memory task in conditions with and without distractor stimuli. In addition, we plan to collect structural MRI brain images in advance and collect fMRI data to determine the precise stimulation location reflecting individual anatomical and functional brain area differences. This is likely to increase the accuracy of the stimulation location and better confirm the differences due to stimulation, providing the possibility for subsequent analysis of individual differences in the effects of TMS.
