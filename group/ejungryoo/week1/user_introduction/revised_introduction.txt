Working memory, a cognitive system that temporarily stores and manipulates information, plays a pivotal role in higher-order thinking and goal-oriented behavior, even in the absence of sustained sensory input [D’Esposito & Postle, 2015]. This system underpins various cognitive functions such as language comprehension, problem-solving, planning, and inference, and is integral to everyday life and learning ability [Cowan, 2014]. Notably, impairments in working memory are frequently observed in mental disorders such as schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and depression [Goldman-Rakic, 1994; Kofler et al., 2011]. Consequently, the exploration of the neural mechanisms of working memory is a critical endeavor in cognitive neuroscience and clinical contexts.

Observations of patients with prefrontal cortex (PFC) lesions reveal impaired working memory function, and research indicates that the PFC remains active during working memory maintenance, underscoring its importance as a neural basis for working memory [Pribram et al., 1964; Curtis & D’Esposito, 2003]. However, studies employing multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) to decode information maintained in working memory from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signal patterns have identified neural representations of working memory information in sensory areas rather than the PFC [Harrison & Tong, 2009; Serences et al., 2009; Christophel et al., 2012; Riggall & Postle, 2012]. These findings suggest that the PFC's function in working memory is to control and regulate attention, while the storage of information is managed by the sensory areas that process the corresponding sensory information. A recent perspective integrates these claims, proposing that working memory is distributed across various brain areas from the sensory cortex to the PFC, contingent on the level of information abstraction [Christophel et al., 2017].

Conversely, the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), in conjunction with the PFC, is recognized as a higher-level brain area crucial to working memory [Todd & Marois, 2004]. Studies using MVPA to examine neural representations of working memory have reported results that can decode stimulus information maintained in working memory from the corresponding sensory area and the PPC [Christophel et al., 2017; Schmidt & Blankenburg, 2018; Kwak & Curtis, 2022]. Our recent preliminary study directly compared neural representations of working memory for tactile and visual stimuli, confirming that supramodal information representations common to sensory modalities emerge in the superior parietal cortex [Park et al., 2025].

For working memory to operate effectively in real-world environments, it is essential to maintain target information stably while resisting external distractor stimuli. This resistance to distraction is a key characteristic of working memory, and higher-order brain areas responsible for attention regulation and inhibition are expected to contribute significantly. As previously noted, the superior parietal cortex is reported to maintain abstract representations that are not dependent on specific sensory formats, transcending simple storage of sensory information. This implies that this area may be associated with functions that maintain more generalized forms of memory content or shield internal representations from external stimuli, rather than sensory details of stimuli. Indeed, prior studies have demonstrated that while the representation of working memory in the PPC remains relatively stable even when distractor stimuli are presented, the representation in the sensory cortex is affected by distractor stimuli [Bettencourt & Xu, 2016; Lorenc et al., 2018; Deutsch et al., 2023]. However, these results, based solely on previous fMRI experiments, cannot establish the causal role of these brain areas in specific cognitive processes. Therefore, this study aims to verify the causal relationship of the resistance to distraction of neural representations in the superior parietal cortex to working memory, employing transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to non-invasively stimulate specific brain areas and temporarily regulate their activity.

In prior TMS-based working memory studies, changes in working memory performance have been primarily examined through stimulation of the PFC, with some studies reporting stimulation of the parietal lobe [Hamidi et al., 2008; Mackey & Curtis, 2017]. However, no study has definitively elucidated the causal role of the superior parietal lobe in resistance to distraction in working memory situations involving distractor stimuli. Therefore, this study intends to measure changes in working memory performance by applying TMS to the superior parietal cortex while performing a working memory task in conditions with and without distractor stimuli. Additionally, we plan to collect structural MRI brain images in advance and gather fMRI data to determine the precise stimulation location reflecting individual anatomical and functional brain area differences. This approach is likely to enhance the accuracy of the stimulation location and more effectively confirm the differences due to stimulation, offering the potential for subsequent analysis of individual differences in the effects of TMS.
